# User Experience (UX)

## User Story

### Intended Audience

The intended audience is for children (4+) an adults of all ages. 

The game of rock, paper or scissors is played as follows: at the same time, the user selects one of three options: a rock, paper or scissors, whilst the computer instantaneously reveals its random choice. A rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. 

The user must try beat the computer in a first to five games to become the winner!

### Realtime User Suggestions

To advance the game further, it would be suggested to add a 'number of games' section, eg first to three games or first to ten games.
