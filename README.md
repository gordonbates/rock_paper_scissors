# User Experience (UX)

## User Story

### Intended Audience

The intended audience for this game is to cater for users of all age groups from young to old. Children aged (4+) and adults of all ages.

The familiar game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is played like this: at the same time, the user selects  one of three options: a rock, paper, or scissors, the computer instantaneously reveals its random choice. A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. 

The user must try beat the computer in a first to 5 games, to become the winner!

### Realtime User Suggestions

To advance the game further, it would be suggested to add a 'number of games' selection, eg first to 3 games or first to 10 games.

# Design

The game design consists of the scoreboard at the top of the page situated above the title of the game. Below that is brief instructions to indicate what the player needs to do to start the game
