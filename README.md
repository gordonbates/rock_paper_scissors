The intended audience for this game is to cater for users of all age groups from young to old. Children aged (4+) and adults of all ages.

The familiar game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is played like this: at the same time, the user selects  one of three options: a rock, paper, or scissors, the computer instantaneously reveals its random choice. A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
